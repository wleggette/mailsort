# Design Ideas

Captured ideas for future features with enough context to pick them up later
without re-investigating from scratch.

## Web UI Threshold Analysis Page (`/analyze`)

**Status:** Designed, not implemented (2026-03-21)

### Concept

Interactive web version of the `mailsort analyze` CLI command. Would show
classification source breakdown, move outcomes, LLM confidence histogram with
current threshold marked, skipped-then-sorted table, and rule correction stats.
Date range picker for filtering.

Full design in [docs/design/web-ui.md](../design/web-ui.md) Phase 5. The CLI
version (`mailsort analyze --days N`) is already implemented in `main.py`.

### Why not yet implemented

Lower priority than the core monitoring pages (dashboard, audit log, rules)
which are all complete. The CLI `analyze` command covers the same data for now.

## List-Unsubscribe Combined Rule

**Status:** Not prioritized (2026-03-21)

### Concept

A new rule type that combines `sender_domain` + presence of the `List-Unsubscribe`
header to classify bulk/marketing emails that lack a `List-Id` header. This would
fill the gap between `list_id` rules (which require a `List-Id` header) and
`sender_domain` rules (which require ≥5 emails from ≥3 distinct senders).

Example: `domain=substack.com + has_unsubscribe=True → Social/Newsletters`

### Analysis (2026-03-21)

Ran `scripts/analyze_list_unsubscribe.py` against 2,628 emails across INBOX,
Affairs/*, and People/* folders. Findings:

| Metric | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| Total emails scanned | 2,628 | 100% |
| Have `List-Unsubscribe` header | 192 | 7.3% |
| Have `List-Unsubscribe` but NO `List-Id` | 156 | 5.9% |
| ↳ Coherent (all go to single folder) | 108 | 4.1% |
| ↳↳ Already covered by `sender_domain` rule | 34 | 1.3% |
| ↳↳ Already covered by `exact_sender` rule | 29 | 1.1% |
| **↳↳ True gap (no existing rule covers)** | **45** | **1.7%** |

The 45 true-gap emails come from 37 domains, almost all single-sender with
1–2 emails each — below the `exact_sender` threshold of 3. They'll naturally
get covered as more email arrives.

Top coherent domains (all go to one folder):

| Domain | Emails | Covered by |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| linkedin.com | 34 | sender_domain (7 senders, 97% coherence) |
| facebookmail.com | 6 | exact_sender (6/6) |
| e.progressive.com | 5 | exact_sender (5/5) |
| lmco.com | 5 | exact_sender (4/5) |

6 domains were split across folders (e.g., `citi.com` across Banks + INBOX)
and wouldn't qualify for any combined rule due to low coherence.

### Why not prioritized

1. **Small incremental value** — only 1.7% of emails would benefit, all from
   low-volume senders that will qualify for `exact_sender` rules over time.
2. **Existing rules cover most of the gap** — 58% of the coherent unsub-only
   emails are already handled by `sender_domain` or `exact_sender` rules.
3. **The combined rule would only help sooner** — it would classify emails at
   1–2 occurrences instead of waiting for 3 (exact_sender threshold). This is
   a marginal timing improvement, not a coverage improvement.

### Implementation notes (from building the analysis script)

**JMAP header property naming:**
- Fastmail's JMAP rejects `header:list-unsubscribe:asText` (the lowercase
  `:asText` variant used for `list-id`). It returns `invalidArguments`.
- The working property name is `header:List-Unsubscribe` (case-sensitive,
  no `:asText` suffix). Returns `null` when the header is absent.
- The existing `JMAPClient` falls back from `EMAIL_PROPERTIES` (which includes
  `header:list-unsubscribe:asText`) to `_EMAIL_PROPERTIES_NO_UNSUB` when it
  gets an error — so the client silently drops the header. If implementing
  this feature, the property name in `EMAIL_PROPERTIES` needs to be fixed to
  `header:List-Unsubscribe`.

**Where the header is already modeled:**
- `JMAPEmail.list_unsubscribe` field exists in `jmap/models.py` (aliased to
  `header:list-unsubscribe:asText`) — would need the alias updated.
- `EmailFeatures.list_unsubscribe` field exists — already carries the value
  through the pipeline.
- The `_EMAIL_PROPERTIES_NO_UNSUB` fallback in `jmap/client.py` would need
  updating if the property name changes.

**Rule engine changes needed:**
- New rule type `domain_unsubscribe` (or extend `sender_domain` with a flag).
- Auto-rule generation: evaluate domain coherence for emails where
  `list_unsubscribe IS NOT NULL AND list_id IS NULL`.
- Classification priority: would slot between `list_id` and `exact_sender`
  (since it's broader than exact_sender but more specific than plain
  sender_domain).

### Analysis script

`scripts/analyze_list_unsubscribe.py` — scans Fastmail folders and reports
List-Unsubscribe prevalence, coverage gaps, and domain coherence. Can be re-run
to reassess if this feature becomes worth implementing as email volume grows.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/analyze_list_unsubscribe.py
```

Requires `FASTMAIL_API_TOKEN` in `.env` (read-write token works; read-only
token also works but the header property may fail on some token configurations).
